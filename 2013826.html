					It was so cold that the cars reminded me of people on bikes traveling extremely fast in first gear. Their legs a blur of meat, their lungs on the cusp of delfation. The vehicles were sort of like this, trying so hard to fight back the cold. They were exploding gasoline within their steel hearts trying their best to generate some heat on this frigid December day. I was on the pedestrian sidewalk crossing the Sid Buckwold Bridge, my face swaddled in a scarf. Through the many layers wrapping around my head, I heard a sickening crash that sounded like someone ran a squeaky shopping cart into a pyramid of glass canning jars. My eyes opened huge and I spun around to see what had happened.
					<br><br>
					There on the Sid Buckwold Bridge, before my very eyes, was a Multiple Vehicle Collision. I had heard about them in movies and video games but I had never witnessed one in real life. It was insane. One car was totally smashed to pieces. It was in such a sorry state I don't think anyone would ever want to drive it again, much less buy it used on Kijiji. The car that it smashed into was also looking pretty bad, but really it was only one side of the car that was crumpled like looseleaf. The other side of the car (I could see both sides from where I was standing, with only slight head craning) was in great shape. The driver of the car must have just washed it, because the side that wasn't involved in the collision looked fine indeed. Mint, even.
					<br><br>
					Minutes after the terribly loud sound I had heard, the doors of the cars cracked open and out slithered two men, one from each car. The car that had done the smashing was piloted by a white-skinned man who was not dressed for the weather. He was wearing a shirt with a collar, and didn't have a toque on. He was bleeding from many places - I would guess five places. The driver of the car that was hit on just one side crawled out of the passenger-side door, got to his feet, and looked at the good side of his car. He looked alright, unshaken. Then he walked around to the other side of his car and saw what kind of damage there was, and this was when he started whining. The two men walked toward one another and appeared to be exchanging words that I could not hear. I have a gift for reading body language, though, and the men appeared to be saying "FUCKING DAMN IT" over and over again, sometimes at themselves, but sometimes at each other. This went on for a few minutes, and the longer it went on, the more heated the conversation appeared. The men's fists formed rock-like shapes. The man dressed poorly for the weather raised his hand, as if to strike the other man.
					<br><br>
					SMAAAAAAAASH! 
					<br><br>
					Another loud noise nearly popped my ear drums as a stumbled back into the railing, almost falling over into the icy, icy water below. "The fuck was that!" I asked myself as I looked again toward the sound. It was another car that had been barrelling down the Sid Buckwold Bridge. Instead of slowing down and gawking at the Multiple Vehicle Collision like the rest of the traffic, this guy apparently wanted a piece of the action and decided to decimate the back end of the first car, the one with the smashed up front. I am not exaggerating when I say that at this point, this car is NEVER being driven again. The front is smashed, the back is smashed, and all of the things inside the car are probably smashed as well. The driver of the car had dropped his fist at this point, and wore a face that looked pretty smashed up, in its own way. The man driving the third car - which was actually a truck - stepped down from his truck and joined the other two men in their contemplation. One of the men pulled out his cellphone and was presumably either calling the cops or a taxi.
					<br><br>
					Lots of other less-smashed cars drove slowly past the three doozies and the drivers all watched in silent pleasure at those less fortunate than them. The wind started to pick up and the detritus laying on the road began to lose its novelty. I continued walking home across the Sid Buckwold Bridge. I could hear sirens behind me.
