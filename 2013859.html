					Shortly before 7:00 AM on Saturday December 21st, 2013 the Saskatoon Police Service responded to a west side address following a call regarding shots being fired inside the home. A full investigative team of sixteen officers entered the home politely after knocking and gave the place a thorough once-over. A 29 year-old woman and a 28 year-old male were the sole occupants of the abode. <br><br>

"Well folks, I don't see any shootings going on here, so I think we'll be on our way." said the officer in charge. He touched the brim of his hat and instinctively the other 15 officers did the same. <br><br>

He spun on his heel and began exiting the house when the female occupant spoke up from behind him.<br><br>

"There's no one firing weapons <i>now</i>, but this ass hole took a shot at me fifteen minutes before you showed up!" she said, visibly stressed. The man beside her said nothing and did not make eye contact with any of the other 34 eyes in the room.<br><br>

The officer turned back around and looked genuinely intrigued. He hesitated for a second, then asked in a hushed voice, "You're saying... there's a bullet <i>hiding</i> somewhere in this house?"<br><br>

His eyes scanned the room, looking for distinctive bullet hidey-holes in the walls or ceiling. "ALRIGHT TEAM," he commanded with a hand motion that probably meant the same thing, "SPREAD OUT AND LOOK FOR HOLES."<br><br>

The army of officers wasted no time in getting to work. They spread out throughout the modest single-floor house, climbing over furniture and looking underneath couches and shelves. One officer was inspecting the kitchen cutlery, while three others were tapping on walls, looking for hollow compartments that the bullet could be stowing away in.<br><br>

"Have you checked yourself for bullet holes?" one officer asked the female occupant. "They're about the size of a cheeto or a really small mouse. Like a baby mouse, I mean."<br><br>

"I wasn't shot!" the woman said. "The bullet went past me and into the wall right here!" She pointed to her left at a section of wall behind a reclining chair. The officers in the room abandoned their individual searches and huddled together around the small hole in the drywall. <br><br>

The officer in charge pushed his way through the gaping group and procured a small official-looking magnifying glass from his pocket designed to hold magnifying glasses. He bent over and peered at the hole for what felt like seconds. Then with a satisfied snort, he stood back up.<br><br>

"Nothing to see here, everyone. This isn't a bullet hole, it is in fact a hole professionally drilled into the wall for access to cable TV." the officer said as he tucked the magnifying glass back into its pocket.<br><br>

The woman stared at the officer in disbelief. The male occupant of the house was trying to pull something large and L-shaped out of his pocket.<br><br>

"There is is, he has the gun!" the woman cried as the man finally pulled the handgun out of his pants.<br><br>

<b>BLAM!</b><br><br>

The gun went off again and the sound was extremely loud. All of the seventeen officers - one more had run into the house from the street to see what the noise was about - were staring around the room, wide-eyed.<br><br>

"Did anyone see it?!" the officer in charge asked the room. They all shook their heads. No one had seen where the bullet went.<br><br>

"ALRIGHT TEAM," the officer in charge shouted, "I want a perimeter set up around this room. No one leaves except for lunch breaks, and no one else is allowed to come in! If you're leaving, make sure you get a stamp."<br><br>

The officers scrambled to follow orders. One began unrolling CAUTION tape and another stood on the street directing traffic that would undoubtedly be there at some point.<br><br>

The woman had sank onto the couch and was looking very pale. The officer in charge sat down beside her and put a hand on her shoulder. "It's alright ma'am. The man with the gun just left, and he didn't get his hand stamped, so you won't need to worry about him coming back in here until we're gone." He stood up and pulled the magnifying glass from its pocket again.<br><br>

"We're going to have to get down to business here, team. A single bullet living in the walls is one thing, but two... that means there could be baby bullets being squeezed off in here within hours."<br><br>

Detectives are presently investigating the matter. There is no further information available at this time.<br><br>

A future release will be promulgated once more information is known.<br><br>
