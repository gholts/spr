					On Wednesday, December 18, 2013, frontline members of the Saskatoon Media Community will begin carrying Conducted Energy Weapons (CEWs).<br><br>

The weapons were made available to members of the media after Constable John McCluskey repeatedly failed to answer an inquiry from CTV Sports Anchor Kevin Waugh. Waugh expressed worry that the scales were tipping unfavorably towards police, and commented "if police can carry them, why can't we?" Witnesses describe the question as having been made in jest by the famously witty Waugh. Nevertheless, an inexplicably panicked McCluskey began stumbling over basic English responses, before inadvertently issuing a referendum arming select members of radio and television with highly advanced near-future weaponry.<br><br>

In a demonstration at local news giant Global Saskatoon, the weapons were used repeatedly on members of the Saskatoon blogging community. Daniel Hudson of Community Radio 90.5 commented, "I'm ready, man, check it out. I am the ultimate badass! State of the badass art! You do NOT wanna fuck with me." The 44 CEWs will be stored at Global News Headquarters to be signed out by tv and radio personalities for the duration of their shift. McCluskey, 43, was visibly shaken by the ordeal and wondered aloud whether his days of briefing the media were over.
