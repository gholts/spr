				</div>

				<p>
					A staff member at a Saskatoon school contacted the police this morning regarding a Suspicious Male Vehicle that she had seen out of her 4th grade window as she peeked through the classroom's bent and battered blinds. "SHHH!" the teacher hissed over her shoulder at the 30-40 kids currently losing their minds in the early minutes of what was supposed to be their Math class.
					<br><br>
					The teacher tracked the Suspicious Male Vehicle as it idled down the icy road. She wasn't sure at first whether the vehicle was Male or Female, but as it passed, she snuck a glimpse under the rear end of the metal beast. Jutting stiffly out from beneath the dirty bumper was a tailpipe so long and blackened it would have made an Oldsmobile blush. 'Oh my,' the teacher said to herself under her breath. She looked over her shoulder once again at her students, who were currently slamming their books onto the ground to see whose would make the loudest WHAMM noise. She turned back to the window just in time to see the car pulling a slow U-turn at the end of the block. The staff member glanced at her watch - five minutes of class had already gone by. She turned away from the blinds, about to walk to the front of the room and restore order, but she couldn't help herself. She opened the window blinds again with two of her fingers and snuck another glance at the Male Vehicle making its way back down the street.
					<br><br>
					The vehicle and its massive, manly tailpipe puttered slowly past the school again. The teacher could feel her pulse quicken as she glanced again - this time unashamed - at the massive steel pipe hanging out the back of the car. It was almost dragging on the ground. It passed by her window, and when she saw the license plate, she quickly scribbled it down on the back of one of the students' homework assignments. The car was at the other end of the block and was preparing to turn around once again, when she noticed a gaggle of female students standing outside, giggling to themselves and pointing at the car. The teacher stiffened and her face cooled to a calm resolve. "CHILDREN!" she shrieked. The children winced in response and scrambled to their seats. "I need to go report a... suspicious vehicle to the principal. Stay in your seats and begin working on what we were learning yesterday!"
					<br><br>
					The teacher strode out of the room and closed the door quietly behind her. Before she began walking to the principal's office down the hall, she looked at herself in the hallway window. She smoothed her blouse and while doing so, brushed her hand against her nipple. She shivered. She couldn't get that tailpipe out of her head. She adjusted her bangs and took a deep breath. There would be no female students checking out the Male Vehicle on her watch. She remembered that she had written down the license plate, and she smiled. Maybe after work it would take her for a ride.
