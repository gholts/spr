				<p>
				Saskatoon Police were called to the scene of a three-vehicle collision at Circle Drive East & 108th Street. The Collision Analyst Unit was out in force. One lane remained open and traffic inched along hoping to get a glimpse of what was surely a fantastic juxtaposition of eviscerated flesh and twisted steel. This was his life. The life of a police officer. A lethargy of pain and suffering. A voice could be heard fighting against the wind. <br><br>

"Reynolds", it echoed; "We got a live one here".<br><br>

It wasn't a survivor. There were no survivors this time. It was a witness.<br><br>

"This is Jeremy Hendrickson... says he saw it all go down".<br><br>

Reynolds eyed him up. Hendrickson was probably 25, but he looked 16 like so many of his generation. He was leaned up against his car (a Honda Civic naturally) looking visibly shaken.<br><br>

"Two"<br><br>

"What?" Reynolds responded.<br><br>

"There were two of them" he trembled. Reynolds knew this wouldn't be easy.<br><br>

"Two people?" he said, desiring clarity.<br><br>

"Two Cars!!" the mid-20's teen shouted, exasperated. "They took out everything! Banks, Cops, Civilians. It was like they were crazy or something!"<br><br>

Reynolds was confused. The accident was bad, sure, but banks? It was a freeway. Hendrickson had been through the shit, that much was clear. But his responses were nonsensical. The kid's story was a canvas. The more paint that was added, the more vibrant it became. Corrupt cops, drug lords, professional driving squads. Millions of dollars were on the line. This was movie spectacle... but in a weird way it all made sense. The chief... no it couldn't be... but... impossible. It couldn't have been McCluskey. But why else would this happen. He wasn't crazy. There was something real about this story. Something sinister.<br><br>

"The pieces are all here", Reynolds muttered to himself. "I just have to make them fit".<br><br>

"But the bank vault...the bank vault is what did the damage". So lost was he in the conspiracy his mind had unravelled that Reynolds almost missed the latest of Hendrickson's ramblings.<br><br>

"What do you mean vault?" Reynolds asked, puzzled at how this latest number fit into his equation.<br><br>

"The cars were dragging a bank vault behind them".<br><br>

Suddenly it all made sense. It was the chief. It was McCluskey. It was... Fast Five. The police department had screened it in the break room a week earlier. Reynolds could hear his coworkers sniggering behind him. Hendrickson had played him like a fiddle. He took a terrible accident and made a joke of it at Reynolds expense. Confusion and anger washed over him like a tidal wave. He would never hear the end of this at work.<br><br>

"You enjoy wasting people's time, kid?" Reynolds said with disdain. Hendrickson just stared. A thousand yard stare. Reynolds had been played the fool.<br><br>

"Wait..." the young man said. Reynolds turned, expecting a more overt jab to top off the subtle embarrassment Hendrickson had inflicted.<br><br>

"I saw one of the drivers... I know who it was".<br><br>

Reynolds knew it was a long shot. But there was hope. Hope that out of this cruel scenario of perpetual defeat, he could at least get a clue.<br><br>

"Alrite kid, be honest... who was it" he asked. This was it. Redemption.<br><br>

"It was Vin Diesel"<br><br>

Uproarious laughter broke out amongst the police officers at the site. The embarrassment was complete. Reynolds made a beeline for his vehicle. He was tired of being stung by wind and laughter. Before he could enter his car, a passing civilian vehicle rolled down its window.<br><br>

"I drove by here earlier... Hell of a way to go, eh officer?" said a stern male voice from the car window. Reynolds could question this man. Reynolds could get this man's statement. But why bother, he thought. It's just another chance for failure. He'd lost enough pride for one day. Still, a response was tendered.<br><br>

"Some people just won't slow down" Reynolds quipped.<br><br>

"Can't say I disagree with that logic" The man responded. Then he whispered something, rolled up his window, and drove away. Reynolds entered his car. What was it that he heard? The words were so soft that they had almost been taken away by the wind and yet... Jeremy Hendrickson. The thousand yard stare. What had he seen?<br><br>

"Impossible", he said aloud. But his ears and his mind disagreed. He'd pieced it all together. He'd heard those words before...<br><br>
