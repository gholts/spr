				<p>
					On December 17th, 2013, Saskatoon Police were called to the scene of a robbery in a business located in the 1500 block of Rayner Avenue. The scene was surprisingly laid back. Officers opened the door to the business, and were surprised to see the business owner leaning back in his chair, smoking what appeared to be an e-cigarette. <br><br>

"Hey boys," he said as the eight officers - expecting there to be a lot more work to do - stomped their sixteen black leather boots on the carpet just inside the door. The noise was thunderous and it shook the paneled walls of the small building. The business owner pressed the little silver button on his e-cig again and took a deep vapourous hit. "S'about time you showed up. This place was robbed nearly twenty minutes ago." <br><br>

After a brief discussion between the officers, they decided to send six of their staff back to the station, since they were only contributing to the crowding of the already-tiny business. The two officers that remained pulled a couple short stools up to the counter at which the business owner was lounging behind and asked him to regale them with what happened 20 minutes prior. The business owner took another hoot from the e-cig and passed it to the officer on his left. "Well boys, it went a little something like this..." <br><br>

"Shortly after 6:00 PM, 2 suspects, a male and a female, entered the business and demanded cash from me, the employee. Now, you know me. You know that I ain't the kind of cat to just throw down handouts just because a cute couple waltzes in and asks for it, you know? So I told them to go fuck a hole in the ground. You could tell that they didn't like this much, though the female did giggle a little bit. Probably didn't fit in with the master scheme that they hatched this morning. So I went back to my crossword and pretended that they weren't there. They played it cool for a while, walking around the business, pretending to compare prices and all that jazz. They must have just been building up their courage, because it wasn't five minutes later when the male produced a knife. He just produced it! This thing must have been twenty-six inches long, maybe even thirty. That mother-fucker must have had it down his pant leg or something. More of a sword than a knife, really. And now that I think about it, I'm pretty sure it had a hilt. But I digress. The little shit was waving it in my face, obviously pretty proud of himself." <br><br>

The officer passed the e-cigarette to his partner and blew some steam out his nose. "Damn, sir. Sounds like you must have been pretty scared." <br><br>

"Shit, you kidding me? He couldn't have been more than 14 or 15 years old, about 5'9", wearing some kind of desperado costume or something. He had a mask on too, probably 'cuz he was so ugly. But I went along with him, ya know? I put my hands up and pasted a genuine look of terror on my face. 'Oh please lord don't let me die today!' I said, much to the pleasure of the couple. They grabbed a couple handfuls of cash from the register - their tiny mitts could only grip a few 50s at a time - as well as some lotto tickets and cigarettes. And then, just as I was lowering my arms, preparing to wish them good day, the little bastard asked for my shoes. My shoes! I figured fuck it, so I took 'em off and chucked them at him. Then the kids took off in a blue car that was idling outside, and then you fellas showed up." <br><br>

"Shit." the two officers said at about the same time. <br><br>

"So I was just thinkin' about it while you folk were on your way, and those kids were pretty clever, asking me for my shoes. Made it so I couldn't run after them, ya know? Pretty clever, those punks. Pretty clever indeed." <br><br>

"You said there was a boy and a girl? What did the girl look like?" <br><br>

"The girl looked older than the kid, maybe around 18 or 19, with blond-white hair cut very short on the sides and back of her head. Looked like an Amazon. To be honest I was more afraid of her than the boy and his stupid rapier." <br><br>

"And did you catch their ethnicity?" <br><br>

"You can't simply <i>catch</i> ethnicity you insensitive pig. It's not a disease. But they were both white, or something. I don't know. Except the girl. She was Amazonian, like I said." <br><br>

The officers finished scribbling in their tiny pocket notepads, clicked their pens closed, and tucked them in the pocket made specifically for pens. "Well we appreciate your help, sir. We'll let you know if we hear anything." The business owner nodded and leaned back in his chair again. "Any chance I can have another hit off that e-cigarette before we go?" asked one of the officers. <br><br>

The business owner closed his eyes and exhaled a cloud. "It's empty." he said.
