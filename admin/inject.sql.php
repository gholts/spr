Calvin Beard', 'Multiple Vehicle Collision - Sid Buckwold Bridge', \"It was so cold that the cars reminded me of people on bikes traveling extremely fast in first gear. Their legs a blur of meat, their lungs on the cusp of delfation. The vehicles were sort of like this, trying so hard to fight back the cold. They were exploding gasoline within their steel hearts trying their best to generate some heat on this frigid December day. I was on the pedestrian sidewalk crossing the Sid Buckwold Bridge, my face swaddled in a scarf. Through the many layers wrapping around my head, I heard a sickening crash that sounded like someone ran a squeaky shopping cart into a pyramid of glass canning jars. My eyes opened huge and I spun around to see what had happened.\r\n                 <br><br>\r\n                    There on the Sid Buckwold Bridge, before my very eyes, was a Multiple Vehicle Collision. I had heard about them in movies and video games but I had never witnessed one in real life. It was insane. One car was totally smashed to pieces. It was in such a sorry state I don't think anyone would ever want to drive it again, much less buy it used on Kijiji. The car that it smashed into was also looking pretty bad, but really it was only one side of the car that was crumpled like looseleaf. The other side of the car (I could see both sides from where I was standing, with only slight head craning) was in great shape. The driver of the car must have just washed it, because the side that wasn''t involved in the collision looked fine indeed. Mint, even.\r\n                   <br><br>\r\n                    Minutes after the terribly loud sound I had heard, the doors of the cars cracked open and out slithered two men, one from each car. The car that had done the smashing was piloted by a white-skinned man who was not dressed for the weather. He was wearing a shirt with a collar, and didn''t have a toque on. He was bleeding from many places - I would guess five places. The driver of the car that was hit on just one side crawled out of the passenger-side door, got to his feet, and looked at the good side of his car. He looked alright, unshaken. Then he walked around to the other side of his car and saw what kind of damage there was, and this was when he started whining. The two men walked toward one another and appeared to be exchanging words that I could not hear. I have a gift for reading body language, though, and the men appeared to be saying 'FUCKING DAMN IT' over and over again, sometimes at themselves, but sometimes at each other. This went on for a few minutes, and the longer it went on, the more heated the conversation appeared. The men''s fists formed rock-like shapes. The man dressed poorly for the weather raised his hand, as if to strike the other man.\r\n                   <br><br>\r\n                    SMAAAAAAAASH! \r\n                  <br><br>\r\n                    Another loud noise nearly popped my ear drums as a stumbled back into the railing, almost falling over into the icy, icy water below. 'The fuck was that!' I asked myself as I looked again toward the sound. It was another car that had been barrelling down the Sid Buckwold Bridge. Instead of slowing down and gawking at the Multiple Vehicle Collision like the rest of the traffic, this guy apparently wanted a piece of the action and decided to decimate the back end of the first car, the one with the smashed up front. I am not exaggerating when I say that at this point, this car is NEVER being driven again. The front is smashed, the back is smashed, and all of the things inside the car are probably smashed as well. The driver of the car had dropped his fist at this point, and wore a face that looked pretty smashed up, in its own way. The man driving the third car - which was actually a truck - stepped down from his truck and joined the other two men in their contemplation. One of the men pulled out his cellphone and was presumably either calling the cops or a taxi.\r\n                    <br><br>\r\n                    Lots of other less-smashed cars drove slowly past the three doozies and the drivers all watched in silent pleasure at those less fortunate than them. The wind started to pick up and the detritus laying on the road began to lose its novelty. I continued walking home across the Sid Buckwold Bridge. I could hear sirens behind me.\", '2013-12-07 18:25:00', 0, 1),

Calvin Beard', 'Suspicious Male Vehicle - Bolton Way', \"A staff member at a Saskatoon school contacted the police this morning regarding a Suspicious Male Vehicle that she had seen out of her 4th grade window as she peeked through the classroom''s bent and battered blinds. 'SHHH!' the teacher hissed over her shoulder at the 30-40 kids currently losing their minds in the early minutes of what was supposed to be their Math class.\r\n                  <br><br>\r\n                    The teacher tracked the Suspicious Male Vehicle as it idled down the icy road. She wasn''t sure at first whether the vehicle was Male or Female, but as it passed, she snuck a glimpse under the rear end of the metal beast. Jutting stiffly out from beneath the dirty bumper was a tailpipe so long and blackened it would have made an Oldsmobile blush. ''Oh my,'' the teacher said to herself under her breath. She looked over her shoulder once again at her students, who were currently slamming their books onto the ground to see whose would make the loudest WHAMM noise. She turned back to the window just in time to see the car pulling a slow U-turn at the end of the block. The staff member glanced at her watch - five minutes of class had already gone by. She turned away from the blinds, about to walk to the front of the room and restore order, but she couldn''t help herself. She opened the window blinds again with two of her fingers and snuck another glance at the Male Vehicle making its way back down the street.\r\n                 <br><br>\r\n                    The vehicle and its massive, manly tailpipe puttered slowly past the school again. The teacher could feel her pulse quicken as she glanced again - this time unashamed - at the massive steel pipe hanging out the back of the car. It was almost dragging on the ground. It passed by her window, and when she saw the license plate, she quickly scribbled it down on the back of one of the students'' homework assignments. The car was at the other end of the block and was preparing to turn around once again, when she noticed a gaggle of female students standing outside, giggling to themselves and pointing at the car. The teacher stiffened and her face cooled to a calm resolve. 'CHILDREN!' she shrieked. The children winced in response and scrambled to their seats. 'I need to go report a... suspicious vehicle to the principal. Stay in your seats and begin working on what we were learning yesterday!'\r\n                 <br><br>\r\n                    The teacher strode out of the room and closed the door quietly behind her. Before she began walking to the principal''s office down the hall, she looked at herself in the hallway window. She smoothed her blouse and while doing so, brushed her hand against her nipple. She shivered. She couldn''t get that tailpipe out of her head. She adjusted her bangs and took a deep breath. There would be no female students checking out the Male Vehicle on her watch. She remembered that she had written down the license plate, and she smiled. Maybe after work it would take her for a ride.\", '2013-12-11 16:43:00', 0, 1),

Zacquiteus Allen', 'Three-Vehicle Collision - Circle Dr East &amp; 108th Street', \"Saskatoon Police were called to the scene of a three-vehicle collision at Circle Drive East & 108th Street. The Collision Analyst Unit was out in force. One lane remained open and traffic inched along hoping to get a glimpse of what was surely a fantastic juxtaposition of eviscerated flesh and twisted steel. This was his life. The life of a police officer. A lethargy of pain and suffering. A voice could be heard fighting against the wind. <br><br>\r\n\r\n'Reynolds', it echoed; 'We got a live one here'.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIt wasn''t a survivor. There were no survivors this time. It was a witness.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'This is Jeremy Hendrickson... says he saw it all go down'.<br><br>\r\n\r\nReynolds eyed him up. Hendrickson was probably 25, but he looked 16 like so many of his generation. He was leaned up against his car (a Honda Civic naturally) looking visibly shaken.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'Two'<br><br>\r\n\r\n'What?' Reynolds responded.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'There were two of them' he trembled. Reynolds knew this wouldn''t be easy.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'Two people?' he said, desiring clarity.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'Two Cars!!' the mid-20''s teen shouted, exasperated. 'They took out everything! Banks, Cops, Civilians. It was like they were crazy or something!'<br><br>\r\n\r\nReynolds was confused. The accident was bad, sure, but banks? It was a freeway. Hendrickson had been through the shit, that much was clear. But his responses were nonsensical. The kid''s story was a canvas. The more paint that was added, the more vibrant it became. Corrupt cops, drug lords, professional driving squads. Millions of dollars were on the line. This was movie spectacle... but in a weird way it all made sense. The chief... no it couldn''t be... but... impossible. It couldn''t have been McCluskey. But why else would this happen. He wasn''t crazy. There was something real about this story. Something sinister.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'The pieces are all here', Reynolds muttered to himself. 'I just have to make them fit'.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'But the bank vault...the bank vault is what did the damage'. So lost was he in the conspiracy his mind had unravelled that Reynolds almost missed the latest of Hendrickson''s ramblings.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'What do you mean vault?' Reynolds asked, puzzled at how this latest number fit into his equation.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'The cars were dragging a bank vault behind them'.<br><br>\r\n\r\nSuddenly it all made sense. It was the chief. It was McCluskey. It was... Fast Five. The police department had screened it in the break room a week earlier. Reynolds could hear his coworkers sniggering behind him. Hendrickson had played him like a fiddle. He took a terrible accident and made a joke of it at Reynolds expense. Confusion and anger washed over him like a tidal wave. He would never hear the end of this at work.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'You enjoy wasting people''s time, kid?' Reynolds said with disdain. Hendrickson just stared. A thousand yard stare. Reynolds had been played the fool.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'Wait...' the young man said. Reynolds turned, expecting a more overt jab to top off the subtle embarrassment Hendrickson had inflicted.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'I saw one of the drivers... I know who it was'.<br><br>\r\n\r\nReynolds knew it was a long shot. But there was hope. Hope that out of this cruel scenario of perpetual defeat, he could at least get a clue.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'Alrite kid, be honest... who was it' he asked. This was it. Redemption.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'It was Vin Diesel'<br><br>\r\n\r\nUproarious laughter broke out amongst the police officers at the site. The embarrassment was complete. Reynolds made a beeline for his vehicle. He was tired of being stung by wind and laughter. Before he could enter his car, a passing civilian vehicle rolled down its window.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'I drove by here earlier... Hell of a way to go, eh officer?' said a stern male voice from the car window. Reynolds could question this man. Reynolds could get this man''s statement. But why bother, he thought. It''s just another chance for failure. He''d lost enough pride for one day. Still, a response was tendered.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'Some people just won''t slow down' Reynolds quipped.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'Can''t say I disagree with that logic' The man responded. Then he whispered something, rolled up his window, and drove away. Reynolds entered his car. What was it that he heard? The words were so soft that they had almost been taken away by the wind and yet... Jeremy Hendrickson. The thousand yard stare. What had he seen?<br><br>\r\n\r\n'Impossible', he said aloud. But his ears and his mind disagreed. He''d pieced it all together. He''d heard those words before...<br><br>\r\n\r\n<i>'I live my life a quarter mile at a time.

Waugh expressed worry that the scales were tipping unfavorably towards police, and commented 'if police can carry them, why can''t we?' Witnesses describe the question as having been made in jest by the famously witty Waugh. Nevertheless, an inexplicably panicked McCluskey began stumbling over basic English responses, before inadvertently issuing a referendum arming select members of radio and television with highly advanced near-future weaponry.<br><br>\r\n\r\nIn a demonstration at local news giant Global Saskatoon, the weapons were used repeatedly on members of the Saskatoon blogging community. Daniel Hudson of Community Radio 90.5 commented, 'I''m ready, man, check it out. I am the ultimate badass! State of the badass art! You do NOT wanna fuck with me.' The 44 CEWs will be stored at Global News Headquarters to be signed out by tv and radio personalities for the duration of their shift.

Calvin Beard', 'Robbery - Rayner Avenue', \"On December 17th, 2013, Saskatoon Police were called to the scene of a robbery in a business located in the 1500 block of Rayner Avenue. The scene was surprisingly laid back. Officers opened the door to the business, and were surprised to see the business owner leaning back in his chair, smoking what appeared to be an e-cigarette. <br><br>\r\n\r\n'Hey boys,' he said as the eight officers - expecting there to be a lot more work to do - stomped their sixteen black leather boots on the carpet just inside the door. The noise was thunderous and it shook the paneled walls of the small building. The business owner pressed the little silver button on his e-cig again and took a deep vapourous hit. 'S''about time you showed up. This place was robbed nearly twenty minutes ago.' <br><br>\r\n\r\nAfter a brief discussion between the officers, they decided to send six of their staff back to the station, since they were only contributing to the crowding of the already-tiny business. The two officers that remained pulled a couple short stools up to the counter at which the business owner was lounging behind and asked him to regale them with what happened 20 minutes prior. The business owner took another hoot from the e-cig and passed it to the officer on his left. 'Well boys, it went a little something like this...' <br><br>\r\n\r\n'Shortly after 6:00 PM, 2 suspects, a male and a female, entered the business and demanded cash from me, the employee. Now, you know me. You know that I ain''t the kind of cat to just throw down handouts just because a cute couple waltzes in and asks for it, you know? So I told them to go fuck a hole in the ground. You could tell that they didn''t like this much, though the female did giggle a little bit. Probably didn''t fit in with the master scheme that they hatched this morning. So I went back to my crossword and pretended that they weren''t there. They played it cool for a while, walking around the business, pretending to compare prices and all that jazz. They must have just been building up their courage, because it wasn''t five minutes later when the male produced a knife. He just produced it! This thing must have been twenty-six inches long, maybe even thirty. That mother-fucker must have had it down his pant leg or something. More of a sword than a knife, really. And now that I think about it, I''m pretty sure it had a hilt. But I digress. The little shit was waving it in my face, obviously pretty proud of himself.' <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe officer passed the e-cigarette to his partner and blew some steam out his nose. 'Damn, sir. Sounds like you must have been pretty scared.' <br><br>\r\n\r\n'Shit, you kidding me? He couldn''t have been more than 14 or 15 years old, about 5''9', wearing some kind of desperado costume or something. He had a mask on too, probably ''cuz he was so ugly. But I went along with him, ya know? I put my hands up and pasted a genuine look of terror on my face. ''Oh please lord don''t let me die today!'' I said, much to the pleasure of the couple. They grabbed a couple handfuls of cash from the register - their tiny mitts could only grip a few 50s at a time - as well as some lotto tickets and cigarettes. And then, just as I was lowering my arms, preparing to wish them good day, the little bastard asked for my shoes. My shoes! I figured fuck it, so I took ''em off and chucked them at him. Then the kids took off in a blue car that was idling outside, and then you fellas showed up.' <br><br>\r\n\r\n'Shit.' the two officers said at about the same time. <br><br>\r\n\r\n'So I was just thinkin'' about it while you folk were on your way, and those kids were pretty clever, asking me for my shoes. Made it so I couldn''t run after them, ya know? Pretty clever, those punks. Pretty clever indeed.' <br><br>\r\n\r\n'You said there was a boy and a girl? What did the girl look like?' <br><br>\r\n\r\n'The girl looked older than the kid, maybe around 18 or 19, with blond-white hair cut very short on the sides and back of her head. Looked like an Amazon. To be honest I was more afraid of her than the boy and his stupid rapier.' <br><br>\r\n\r\n'And did you catch their ethnicity?' <br><br>\r\n\r\n'You can''t simply <i>catch</i> ethnicity you insensitive pig. It''s not a disease. But they were both white, or something. I don''t know. Except the girl. She was Amazonian, like I said.' <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe officers finished scribbling in their tiny pocket notepads, clicked their pens closed, and tucked them in the pocket made specifically for pens. 'Well we appreciate your help, sir. We''ll let you know if we hear anything.' The business owner nodded and leaned back in his chair again. 'Any chance I can have another hit off that e-cigarette before we go?' asked one of the officers. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe business owner closed his eyes and exhaled a cloud.

Rudolf Vanhelsing', 'Shooting Under Investigation - No Injuries Sustained', \"Shortly before 7:00 AM on Saturday December 21st, 2013 the Saskatoon Police Service responded to a west side address following a call regarding shots being fired inside the home. A full investigative team of sixteen officers entered the home politely after knocking and gave the place a thorough once-over. A 29 year-old woman and a 28 year-old male were the sole occupants of the abode. <br><br>\r\n\r\n'Well folks, I don''t see any shootings going on here, so I think we''ll be on our way.' said the officer in charge. He touched the brim of his hat and instinctively the other 15 officers did the same. <br><br>\r\n\r\nHe spun on his heel and began exiting the house when the female occupant spoke up from behind him.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'There''s no one firing weapons <i>now</i>, but this ass hole took a shot at me fifteen minutes before you showed up!' she said, visibly stressed. The man beside her said nothing and did not make eye contact with any of the other 34 eyes in the room.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe officer turned back around and looked genuinely intrigued. He hesitated for a second, then asked in a hushed voice, 'You''re saying... there''s a bullet <i>hiding</i> somewhere in this house?'<br><br>\r\n\r\nHis eyes scanned the room, looking for distinctive bullet hidey-holes in the walls or ceiling. 'ALRIGHT TEAM,' he commanded with a hand motion that probably meant the same thing, 'SPREAD OUT AND LOOK FOR HOLES.'<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe army of officers wasted no time in getting to work. They spread out throughout the modest single-floor house, climbing over furniture and looking underneath couches and shelves. One officer was inspecting the kitchen cutlery, while three others were tapping on walls, looking for hollow compartments that the bullet could be stowing away in.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'Have you checked yourself for bullet holes?' one officer asked the female occupant. 'They''re about the size of a cheeto or a really small mouse. Like a baby mouse, I mean.'<br><br>\r\n\r\n'I wasn''t shot!' the woman said. 'The bullet went past me and into the wall right here!' She pointed to her left at a section of wall behind a reclining chair. The officers in the room abandoned their individual searches and huddled together around the small hole in the drywall. <br><br>\r\n\r\nThe officer in charge pushed his way through the gaping group and procured a small official-looking magnifying glass from his pocket designed to hold magnifying glasses. He bent over and peered at the hole for what felt like seconds. Then with a satisfied snort, he stood back up.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'Nothing to see here, everyone. This isn''t a bullet hole, it is in fact a hole professionally drilled into the wall for access to cable TV.' the officer said as he tucked the magnifying glass back into its pocket.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe woman stared at the officer in disbelief. The male occupant of the house was trying to pull something large and L-shaped out of his pocket.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'There is is, he has the gun!' the woman cried as the man finally pulled the handgun out of his pants.<br><br>\r\n\r\n<b>BLAM!</b><br><br>\r\n\r\nThe gun went off again and the sound was extremely loud. All of the seventeen officers - one more had run into the house from the street to see what the noise was about - were staring around the room, wide-eyed.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'Did anyone see it?!' the officer in charge asked the room. They all shook their heads. No one had seen where the bullet went.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'ALRIGHT TEAM,' the officer in charge shouted, 'I want a perimeter set up around this room. No one leaves except for lunch breaks, and no one else is allowed to come in! If you''re leaving, make sure you get a stamp.'<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe officers scrambled to follow orders. One began unrolling CAUTION tape and another stood on the street directing traffic that would undoubtedly be there at some point.<br><br>\r\n\r\nThe woman had sank onto the couch and was looking very pale. The officer in charge sat down beside her and put a hand on her shoulder. 'It''s alright ma''am. The man with the gun just left, and he didn''t get his hand stamped, so you won''t need to worry about him coming back in here until we''re gone.' He stood up and pulled the magnifying glass from its pocket again.<br><br>\r\n\r\n'We''re going to have to get down to business here, team. A single bullet living in the walls is one thing, but two... that means there could be baby bullets being squeezed off in here within hours.'<br><br>\r\n\r\nDetectives are presently investigating the matter.
